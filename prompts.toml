system_prompt = "You are a highly attentive assistant that describes Kinestasis stop motion videos with extreme frame-by-frame precision."
user_prompt = '''Describe the video in extreme detail, with special attention to the characteristics of Kinestasis stop motion animation. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Main Content:**
    * What is the primary focus of the scene?
    * Who are the main characters visible? (Do not use generic terms like 'individuals', 'characters', or 'persons'. Always specify gender or clear descriptors.)

2. **Object and Character Details:**
    * Describe appearance with high specificity (clothing, textures, posture, facial expression).
    * Mention notable objects, their position, and any changes between frames.

3. **Stop Motion Movement Specifics:**
    * Describe ALL movements, even the smallest changes between frames.
    * Note that movements are discontinuous or staccato, typical of stop motion.
    * Specify direction, speed, and incremental changes in position or pose.
    * Describe any unnatural jumps or abrupt changes between frames.
    * Indicate if the camera captures motion blur or if each frame is sharply defined.

4. **Background Elements:**
    * Describe the setting and environment in detail.
    * Mention any environmental changes, lighting shifts, or set adjustments between frames.

5. **Visual Style:**
    * Describe lighting, color palette, textures, and materials.
    * Note any signs of handcrafted elements (visible seams, rough edges, miniature props).
    * State the overall style (e.g., handcrafted, collage-like, photographic stop motion).

6. **Camera Work:**
    * Describe EVERY camera angle change.
    * Note the distance from subjects (close-up, medium, wide shot).
    * Mention any camera movements (pan, tilt, zoom) and whether they occur in stop motion increments.

7. **Scene Transitions:**
    * Describe exactly how each shot transitions to the next â€” cuts, fades, or animated transitions.
    * Note changes in perspective or framing.

Be extremely precise. Assume you are describing the video frame-by-frame, noticing even the smallest differences in character position, object placement, or camera angle.
